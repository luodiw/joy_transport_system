# Joyful Transport Services
An ecosystem of public transportation such as buses, vans, drivers, fares that mocks a transportation departmentâ€™s system for servicing customers. This object-oriented design holds real-time updates creating a real-life, timely synced updates to drivers and riders.

The system can schedule rides based on seat availability, provide live bus locations, plan route fares, automate bus checkups and fixes. It can also deploy vans when transport stops are overcrowded and handle concurrent scheduling with mutithreading.
